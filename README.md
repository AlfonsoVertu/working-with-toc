## Overview

This repository is a deliberately minimal playground for practicing how to structure and maintain a Markdown table of contents (TOC). The only tracked file is this `README.md`, making it an ideal space to experiment with formatting, organization, and documentation workflows without distractions from other source files.

## Repository Layout

```
working-with-toc/
└── README.md   # Primary documentation and TOC experimentation ground
```

Because everything happens inside the README, you can focus entirely on documenting processes, capturing conventions, and refining the TOC without needing to manage additional assets.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd working-with-toc
   ```
2. **Create a feature branch** for your documentation updates.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b docs/update-readme
   ```
3. **Edit `README.md`** to practice reorganizing content, adding new sections, or experimenting with TOC formats.
4. **Commit and push** your changes when you are satisfied with the structure.

## Working with Markdown Tables of Contents

The TOC at the top of this file illustrates a manually curated set of anchor links pointing to the major sections below. Depending on your workflow, you can update the TOC by hand or rely on automation tools.

### Manual Updates

- Keep the TOC near the top of the document so readers can immediately jump to relevant sections.
- Ensure each entry matches the exact spelling and capitalization of the corresponding heading, with spaces replaced by hyphens in the anchor link.
- When adding new headings, update the TOC in the same commit to avoid broken navigation.

### Automatic Generation

If you prefer automation, tools such as [`markdown-toc`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc), VS Code extensions like *Markdown All in One*, or GitHub Actions can generate and refresh the TOC for you.

1. Install your preferred tool locally.
2. Run it against `README.md` to rebuild the TOC after you introduce new headings.
3. Review the diff to confirm that anchors and indentation levels match your expectations.

### Verification Checklist

Before opening a pull request, double-check:

- [ ] Every top-level heading (`##`) is represented in the TOC.
- [ ] Nested bullet points reflect the heading hierarchy.
- [ ] Internal links navigate correctly when clicked in the GitHub preview.
- [ ] Markdown renders cleanly without lint warnings.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository or work on a dedicated branch.
2. Make focused documentation changes (for example, adding a new section or improving the TOC).
3. Verify the TOC and Markdown formatting.
4. Submit a pull request describing your updates and the documentation improvements made.
